## Changes to your PDS

Your PDS is amended by the following:

### Change 1 – Amendment to ‘Your responsibilities’

Your PDS is amended by removing the ‘Authorising repairs to your vehicle’ section on page 61 and replacing it with the following:

You must not start, approve or authorise any repairs to your vehicle under any circumstances, unless:

- we allow it under ‘Emergency repairs’ – see pages 17, 29 and 44, or
- you obtain our prior written consent by contacting us on 131 123.

You should seek our agreement before incurring any out-of-pocket expenses to ensure you will be able to claim those costs back on your policy. If you do not obtain our agreement first, we will only pay reasonable costs up to the amount we would have agreed to pay had you obtained our prior agreement. Refer to the ‘How we settle your claim’ section of the policy for information in relation to what are reasonable costs.

If we have cash settled your claim instead of authorising repairs and then you arrange or authorise repairs, we are not responsible for any costs associated with those repairs.

Change 3 – Amendment to Recovery actions

Your PDS is amended by deleting the last two paragraphs in the subsection 'Recovery action by us' on page 71, and replacing it with the following updated wording:

You must give us all the information and co-operation that we reasonably require to take the recovery action. We will only request information or co-operation which is relevant to pursue the recovery action and will provide an explanation as to why it is needed. We will act reasonably in exercising our discretion in the conduct of any legal proceedings and in the settlement of any claim while we conduct any recovery action. We will keep you reasonably informed and updated with the progress of proceedings.

You must not do anything unreasonable which prejudices us in taking any recovery action without our written consent. For example, you must not:

- assign your rights to anyone else; - for example, a tow truck driver or a smash repairer; or
- opt-out of any representative or group proceedings taken by us.

## Our agreement with you

Your policy is a contract between you and us and is made up of:

- your current Certificate of Insurance
- this Product Disclosure Statement and Policy Booklet (PDS), and
- any applicable Supplementary PDS.

## More than one insured

If there’s more than one insured listed on the Certificate of Insurance, then anything that any insured says, does or omits to do applies to all of the insureds. Also, each insured can act on behalf of all the insureds as their agent.

## Certificate of Insurance

Your current Certificate of Insurance shows the type(s) of insurance and any options you have added under your policy. It also shows the period your policy covers – we only cover you for incidents that happen during that time.

## Receiving your policy documents

You may choose to receive your policy documents:

- electronically – that is, by email, or
- by post.

If we send your policy documents to you by email, we will send them to the email address you last gave us. Any policy documents we send to your email address will be considered to have been received by you 24 hours from when we send them.

If we send your policy documents to you by post, we will send them to the mailing address you last gave us.

You are responsible for making sure the email and mailing address we have for you is up to date. So, you need to tell us if you change your email or mailing address – see ‘You change your contact details’ on page 85.
---
## Limits, exclusions and conditions

Limits, exclusions and conditions apply to the cover you have chosen:

- Throughout this PDS, we set out any specific limits, exclusions and conditions with the cover they apply to.
- On pages 55 – 59, we set out the general exclusions that apply to all covers and benefits under your policy.
- On pages 60 – 62, we set out your responsibilities when you are insured with us.

## Special conditions

We may apply special conditions on your policy that may exclude, restrict or extend cover for a person or a particular matter at the time that you purchase the policy. For example, we may not cover you for some incidents like a bushfire, storm or flood if they cause loss or damage during a specific period which is also known as an embargo period.

Your current Certificate of Insurance shows any special conditions that apply to your policy, including the period of any applicable embargo period.

In addition, we may apply special conditions during your policy that limit your ability to make changes to coverage, sum insured and your policy terms.

## Value that applies to your vehicle

Depending on the type of insurance you’ve chosen, we may insure your vehicle for an agreed value or a market value – see Table 1.1 on page 11.

The value that applies to your vehicle is shown on your current Certificate of Insurance.

### Agreed value

The agreed value is the amount we agree to insure your vehicle for. It includes:

- Any modifications, options or accessories that are attached to your vehicle
- GST
- Registration and any CTP insurance
- Other on-road costs

You should take these into account when you decide on your agreed value. It does not include any allowance for dealer profit, warranty costs, any stamp duty or transfer fees.

### Market value

If we insure your vehicle for market value, then we assess its market value when an incident happens.
---
To work out the market value, we look at various things which include:

- local market prices
- your vehicle’s age and condition at the time, and
- any modifications, options or accessories that are attached to your vehicle.

The market value includes:

- GST
- registration and any CTP insurance
- other on-road costs.

It does not include any allowance for dealer profit, warranty costs, any stamp duty or transfer fees.

|Type of insurance|Comprehensive Plus Insurance|Agreed value|Market value|
|---|---|---|---|
|Comprehensive Insurance| |✓|✓|
|Third Party Fire & Theft Insurance| |✓|(up to $10,000)|
|Third Party Property Damage Insurance|Doesn’t apply| | |

Your premium

In return for paying your premium, we provide the cover you have chosen.

Your premium is based on the likelihood of a claim being made under your policy in the future. When we work out your premium, we look at a range of factors including:

- your vehicle and where you keep it
- the age of the insureds and drivers
- the way you use your vehicle – for example, private or business use.

For more information about how we work out your premium, the excesses that may apply to your policy and any discounts you may be eligible for, see our Premium, Excess & Discounts Guide.

---
## Paying your premium

You must pay your premium on time. You can pay your premium:

- annually in one lump sum, or
- in monthly instalments by direct debit from an account or credit card you nominate (if we offer this option to you).

Your current Certificate of Insurance shows the amount you need to pay and the due date for your annual premium or for each monthly instalment.

If you pay annually, you can pay through any of these ways:

|Go to|nrma.com.au/payments|
|---|---|
|or to our Self Service Centre and have your credit card ready| |
| |Make a payment online or by phone banking|
| |Call 131 144 and have your credit card ready|
|Pay in person using, EFTPOS, cheque or credit card at any local branch or Australia Post Office (Australia Post also accepts cash)| |
|Send your cheque or credit card details to the address shown on your notice| |

## What happens if you don’t pay on time

When you take out insurance, you need to pay your annual premium or any instalments by the due date specified on your Certificate of Insurance.

An instalment is unpaid if it cannot be deducted from your nominated account or credit card.

If your premium is overdue, we will send you a notice outlining the overdue amount and when it needs to be paid.

If your premium remains unpaid after the time period specified in the notice we send, we will:

- cancel your policy for non-payment, and
- refuse to pay any claim for an incident occurring after the cancellation date.

If you pay by instalment, we will send you a second notice either before cancellation informing you of the effective date of cancellation, or within 14 days after cancellation confirming the effective date of cancellation.

If you need to make a claim when your policy is overdue, and before your policy has been cancelled for non-payment, we will require you to pay the overdue amount as part of the claim settlement process. Alternatively, where the settlement method allows we can reduce the settlement payment by the overdue amount.
---
21 day cooling-off period

You can tell us to cancel your policy within 21 days from:

- the date we issue your policy – for example, if you call us on 3 May to set up a new policy from 10 May, then your 21 day cooling-off period starts from 3 May as that’s when we issued your policy
- the start date of the policy period that applies when you renew your policy.

If you tell us to cancel your policy within those times, we’ll refund the premium you paid us in full. However, we can only do that if you haven’t made a claim on your policy.

Assigning rights and appointing a representative

Assigning your rights

You must not assign any benefits, rights or obligations under your policy unless you get our written consent first.

Appointing someone to represent you

If you want to appoint someone to represent you, then you need to tell us and we need to agree that we will deal with them on your behalf. For example, you ask someone to manage your policy or a claim. For more details about who you can appoint to manage your claim, such as a repairer, see page 62.

We will not unreasonably withhold our consent to an appointment. However, we may have a concern with a party that may present a conflict of interest. For example, someone who supplies goods or services for your claim.

Governing law and GST

Governing law

This contract is governed by the law of the Australian State or Territory where you keep your vehicle.

GST

All dollar values described in your policy include GST, unless we say they don't.
---
## Comprehensive Plus Insurance

Comprehensive Plus Insurance is the top Motor Insurance cover you can have for your vehicle.

To insure your motorcycle, see Comprehensive Insurance on pages 26 – 39 and Third Party Property Damage Insurance on pages 48 – 51.

The table on the right summarises your cover.

Full details about your cover are set out in this section.

In this section, we outline what you’re covered for under Comprehensive Plus Insurance and any specific limits, exclusions and conditions that apply to your cover.

General exclusions also apply. If you don’t meet your responsibilities you may put your claim or cover at risk – see Section 7.

How we settle a claim is set out in Section 8.

Your choice of repairer must have all the necessary equipment, skills, capabilities, licences and authorisations required by law, to complete the repairs to your vehicle.

Other benefits

Your policy covers loss or damage that is caused by the use of your vehicle to someone else's property – see 'Liability cover' on pages 52 – 54. We may also provide the benefits that are set out in this section.

Crash with at fault driver

If you have a crash with another vehicle during the policy period and the driver of that vehicle is not insured, is at fault in the crash and you can identify the driver and their vehicle as set out below. You don’t need to pay any excess if you make a claim under this benefit

Credit provider’s rights

You must tell us if you have used all or part of your vehicle as security for a loan with a credit provider. Your credit provider may be a bank, credit union or other type of lender. This may also apply if you lease or have a hire purchase agreement on your vehicle.

We note your credit provider on your current Certificate of Insurance.

When you have a noted credit provider:

- we treat your vehicle as being under a finance arrangement
- we treat any statement, act, omission or claim by you as a statement, act, omission or claim by the credit provider
- we may recover any payment either in your name or the credit provider’s name.

Payments to the credit provider

If we decide to pay you for a claim on your vehicle that is under a finance arrangement, we will first pay the credit provider the lower of these amounts after deducting any excess and other deductions that apply:

- the agreed value or market value, depending on the cover you have chosen
- the cost of repairing your vehicle
- the balance owing to the credit provider under the finance arrangement.

If the credit provider is entitled to the salvage of the vehicle, then we will deduct the estimated salvage value of the vehicle from any amount that we pay.

However, we will only pay the credit provider if they:

- are noted on your current Certificate of Insurance
- give us any help we ask for.

If we make a payment to a credit provider, then that payment discharges our obligation to you under your policy for the amount paid.

If we decide to settle your claim as a total loss, then in order to finalize your claim:

we will check the Personal Property Securities Register to confirm whether any money is owing on your vehicle
you must provide reasonable co-operation to enable us to resolve financial arrangements and assist with vehicle salvage.

Businesses registered for GST

Before we make a payment, we deduct an amount equal to your input tax credit entitlement. This applies to any amount we pay, including where we state that an amount will include GST.

Any payment we make to settle your claim will be considered to be made in full even if we have reduced the amount we pay as described above.

Recovery actions

You agree that following provisions, which appear under the headings Recovery action by us and Recovery action by you apply where we cover you under the policy for some or all of the loss or damage you suffer in connection with an incident.

Recovery action by us

You agree we may, if we choose to, take steps to recover from someone else we consider responsible for the incident:

- some or all of the loss or damage we cover; and/or
- some or all of the loss or damage which we do not cover, whether or not it is covered by another insurer or you do not have cover for it.

You agree we may take such recovery action:

- without your consent;
- using your name; and
- whether or not you have been, or have a right to be, fully compensated for all of your loss or damage by us or anybody else.

Examples of recovery action we may take include:

- conducting legal proceedings using your name, including as an applicant or plaintiff in representative or group proceedings (commonly known as class actions);
- conducting legal proceedings on your behalf as a member of representative or group proceedings;
- taking over the conduct of legal proceedings started by you or on your behalf, including as an applicant or plaintiff in representative or group proceedings;
- exercising any statutory or contractual rights, including rights to opt-out, that you have in or in connection with representative or group proceedings; and/or
- entering into contracts in your name in relation to litigation funding or legal representation, including where entry into those agreements causes you to become a group member of representative or group proceedings.

We have in our discretion the right to decide upon the conduct and any settlement of any recovery action we take.
---
You agree we may exercise all the rights you have in connection with the loss or damage you have suffered in connection with the incident.

Claims and what we pay

Of any amount recovered in recovery action we take, you agree we first keep the amount we have paid, or must pay, you under the policy plus any interest recovered on that amount and any administrative, recovery agent, funding and legal costs we have incurred in taking the recovery action. We will then pay you the amount of loss or damage you have suffered in connection with the incident for which you do not have any cover with us plus any interest recovered on that amount and costs you may have been required by us to contribute. Finally, we keep any remaining balance.

You must give us all the information and co-operation that we require to take the recovery action. We will only request information or co-operation which is relevant to pursue the recovery action and we will provide an explanation as to why it is needed.

You must not do anything which prejudices us in taking any recovery action without our written consent. For example, you must not:

- assign your rights to anyone else; – for example, a tow truck driver or a smash repairer; or
- opt-out of any representative or group proceedings taken by us.

Recovery action by you

You may only take recovery action with our prior written consent and on conditions which we in our discretion impose.

You must have proper regard for our interests in respect of loss or damage that we cover.

You must seek to recover the loss or damage we cover in addition to any other loss or damage you have suffered in connection with the incident.

Of any amount recovered in recovery action you take, you may first keep the amount of loss or damage you have suffered in connection with the incident and for which you do not have any cover with us plus any interest recovered on that amount and any administrative and legal costs you have incurred in taking the recovery action. You will then pay us the amount we have paid, or must pay, you under the policy plus interest recovered on that amount. Finally, you keep or pay any remaining balance in accordance with any other obligations you have.

You agree we may:

- take over the conduct of legal proceedings started by you or on your behalf, including where you are an applicant or plaintiff, or a group member, in representative or group proceedings; and
- require you to cease recovery action that you have commenced.

## Repairing your vehicle

If we choose to settle your claim by repairing your vehicle – see Option 1 on page 67 – then we decide the best way to repair the damage.

If you make a claim and we agree to repair your vehicle, we will arrange for an NRMA Partner Repairer to fix your vehicle or you may choose your own repairer to fix your vehicle if:

- you have Comprehensive Plus Insurance and you have added the 'Any Repairer’ option – see page 25, or
- you have Comprehensive Insurance and:
- you have added the ‘Any Repairer’ option – see page 39, or
- your vehicle is a motorcycle, or
- you have Third Party Fire & Theft insurance – see page 42, or
- you have Third Party Property Damage Insurance – see page 50.

## Choosing a repairer

If we arrange for an NRMA Partner Repairer to fix your vehicle we will:

- help find an NRMA Partner Repairer most convenient to you
- choose the most suitable repair method for the type of damage to your vehicle
- manage the whole repair process on your behalf
- arrange for part of the repair to be carried out by a specialist service provider, if required – for example windscreen repairs.

If you are entitled to choose your own repairer to fix your vehicle. Your choice of repairer must have all the necessary equipment, skills, capabilities, licences and authorisations required by law, to complete the repairs to your vehicle.

Once you’ve chosen a repairer, we will:

- choose the most suitable repair method for the type of damage to your vehicle and decide whether to authorise and pay for the reasonable cost to repair your vehicle, or
- decide whether to pay you the reasonable cost to repair your vehicle as determined by us. In determining the reasonable cost, we may consider several factors, including quotes from NRMA Partner Repairers, our nominated repair methods for the type of damage to your vehicle and reports from our assessors.

We are not responsible for making sure the repairer can complete the repairs when it suits you. Also, we don’t cover:

- any additional costs incurred through extensive delays caused by you or a repairer chosen by you because a part isn’t readily available.
- any repairs not authorised by us.

We will require you to contribute to the costs if the repairs to your vehicle leave it in a better condition than before the incident, however we will not proceed with these repairs until we have discussed this with you and sought your agreement.
---
Inspections

If we ask, you must allow us to inspect your vehicle.

If so, we will:

- tell you where you need to take your vehicle at a reasonable time, or
- arrange for it to be towed to a repairer or other place we choose at a reasonable time.

Lifetime guarantee on authorised repairs

If we authorise and pay for a repairer to fix your vehicle, then we provide a lifetime guarantee for the workmanship of those repairs as long as you are the owner of your vehicle.

We will choose to settle your claim under our lifetime guarantee through any of these ways:

- we can arrange for the original repairer or an NRMA Partner Repairer to repair your vehicle
- we can choose to pay you the reasonable cost to repair your vehicle as determined by us. We determine what the reasonable cost is to repair your vehicle by looking at a range of factors, including quotes from the original repairer or NRMA Partner Repairers, our nominated repair methods for the type of damage to your vehicle and reports from our assessors, or
- we can choose to pay you an amount that is equal to the market value of a vehicle at the time of your lifetime guarantee claim. The market value will be determined based on vehicles of the same make, model, engine size, equipment level and paint type, without the defect which is the subject of your lifetime guarantee claim. If we do this, we will keep your vehicle.

Our choice will have regard to the circumstances of your claim and consider any preference you may have.

However, you can’t claim under our lifetime guarantee if:

- you sold your vehicle – that is, you are no longer the owner of your vehicle
- you (or your agent) authorised repairs to your vehicle without our prior written consent
- you arrange repairs after we cash settle your claim – that is, we do not authorise repairs
- there is loss or damage to or failure of any electrical or mechanical part or component, or
- there is deterioration or wear and tear caused:

- over time
- by using your vehicle
- by exposing your vehicle to the elements – for example, faded or damaged paint from exposure to sun, dirt and/or corrosive materials, or
- by your failure to maintain your vehicle in good order and repair.

We decide on how to fix any fault caused by poor workmanship.
---
## Parts used to repair your vehicle

Generally, we use the following parts to repair your vehicle. If your vehicle is:

- under 3 years, we use genuine new parts (when reasonably available)
- 3 years or older, we use:
- genuine new parts (when reasonably available), or
- quality non-mechanical reusable parts.

Regardless of your vehicle’s age, we may use non-genuine parts for windscreens, sunroofs, window glass, radiators and air conditioning components.

We only use quality non-mechanical reusable parts when it:

- is consistent with the age and condition of your vehicle
- does not affect the safety or the structural integrity of your vehicle
- complies with your vehicle manufacturer's specifications and applicable Australian Design Rules
- does not adversely affect the way your vehicle looks after it has been repaired
- does not void or affect the warranty provided by your vehicle’s manufacturer.

## Unrepaired damage

If your vehicle had any unrepaired damage before an incident, then you may need to contribute to the repair costs, however we will not proceed with these repairs until we have discussed this with you and sought your agreement. You need to do that when the unrepaired damage results in us having to repair more areas of your vehicle than:

- were affected by the incident, or
- we needed to replace.

For example, your bonnet is only partly damaged in a crash and can be repaired. The repairer notices that the bonnet has unrepaired hail damage. If there wasn’t any hail damage, then we would only need to repair the damaged area of the bonnet. However, because of the unrepaired hail damage, we must replace the whole bonnet. So, we will discuss these repairs with you and seek your agreement to contribute to the cost.

## Undamaged areas

We don’t repair undamaged areas of your vehicle to create a uniform appearance. In the event of repairs, we will make a fair and reasonable attempt to match the repairs to undamaged areas, using the closest match available.

If you are not satisfied with the closest match, you are able to:

- pay the extra cost of repairing undamaged areas to achieve a matching appearance; or
- we will pay you what it would have cost us to repair the damaged area.
---
For example, if the incident causes damage to the right panel, then we will only pay to respray the right panel. We won’t pay the cost to respray the rest of the vehicle.

## Excesses and other deductions

An excess is an amount you contribute towards the cost of a claim. If we pay your claim as a total loss, we will deduct other amounts to settle your claim.

## Excesses

Your current Certificate of Insurance shows the amount and types of excesses that apply to your policy. The type of excess you need to pay depends on what your claim relates to and who was driving your vehicle. Also, you may need to pay more than one excess.

Type of excess
Basic
Age
Special

Table 8.2 shows the types of excesses that may apply to your claim. In some cases, you may not need to pay any excess – see ‘When you don’t need to pay an excess’ on page 77.

Type of excess
Basic - Applies to most claims
Age - An age excess applies in addition to pe basic excess when pe driver is:
- under 25 years (a higher age excess applies if pe driver is not named on your policy)
- 25 years or older wip no more pan 2 years driving experience after obtaining a provisional or probationary licence

Special - Any special excess is outlined in your current Certificate of Insurance and applies in addition to any oper excesses
---
Claims that are less than your excess

We only accept a claim if the total amount you are claiming for is more than any excesses that apply to your claim.

For example, we will accept your claim for $1,200 damage to your vehicle when we pay your excess is $695. But we won't accept your claim for $500 damage when your excess is $695.

Paying your excess

When you make a claim an excess may apply. If so, we will:

- deduct the excess from any claim payment, or
- request you pay the excess to us or, to the repairer or supplier.

If we request you pay the excess, we will tell you who to pay and may require payment as part of the finalisation of your claim.

Changing your basic excess

You can reduce your premium by choosing a higher basic excess if you have:

- Comprehensive Plus Insurance
- Comprehensive Insurance.

If you do that, then 'Choice of Excess' is shown on your current Certificate of Insurance.

When you don’t need to pay any excess

You don’t need to pay any excess if:

- you make a claim for an incident that we are satisfied was not your fault or the fault of any other person we cover, and
- you can give us the name and residential address of the at fault driver.

See ‘Determining fault in an incident’ on the following page.

If we are unable to determine that someone else was responsible, the excess is payable.

Determining fault in an incident
For some claims we will need to decide if you, your driver, a passenger in your vehicle or someone else was not at fault in certain incidents.
This will enable us to decide:
- when an excess does not apply, or
- if you are entitled to any optional covers, such as:
- Hire car after a not at fault collision or crash
- Crash with at fault driver
- Hire car after an incident

To assist us to do this you will need to provide us the name and residential address of a person(s) who you believe was at fault.
To determine that you or your driver was not at fault for the collision we may request additional information – for example witness statements or photographs – and consider any laws, bylaws or rules that apply to the claim circumstances.

Other deductions
If we pay your claim as a total loss, then we deduct other amounts to settle your claim.

Unpaid premiums
If you currently pay your premium by monthly instalments, then before we pay your claim we need to deduct:
- any premiums that are due but haven’t been paid
- the monthly instalments that cover the rest of your policy period.

Unused registration and CTP insurance
The amount you pay to register your vehicle or for any CTP insurance forms part of your vehicle’s value. So if we pay your claim, we will deduct any unused registration costs and CTP insurance premium.
To get a refund, you need to contact your:
- relevant motor registration authority
- CTP insurer if your vehicle is registered in NSW (in NSW, CTP insurance is also known as a Greenslip).

Salvage value
In most cases when we pay your claim, we usually keep your vehicle. However, if we let you keep your damaged vehicle, then we’ll deduct its estimated salvage value before we pay your claim.
For more details, see Table 8.1 on page 68.

Other information you need to know

When you take out insurance wip us, you need to know some oper important pings like pe changes you can make to your policy, how we resolve a complaint and how we manage your personal information.
---
## Changes to your policy

This section describes the changes that you or we can make to your policy.

### Additional premium or refund less than $15

When a change is made to your policy, you may need to pay us an additional premium or we may need to refund part of your premium. If the additional premium we need to charge you is less than $15, then we’ll waive it – that is, you don’t need to pay it. However, if the amount we need to refund is less than $15, then we’ll donate it to charity.

### Changes you can make

You may need to make a change to your policy or decide to cancel it.

|Call|Visit|Visit|
|---|---|---|
|132 132|nrma.com.au|a local branch|

If we need to give you a refund, then we will only refund any unused premium back to the start date of your current policy period. To do that, you may need to give us any proof we ask for. For example, 7 months ago you paid out the finance arrangement for your vehicle. However, you forgot to tell us when you renewed your policy 3 months ago. We will refund any extra premium that may have applied for the last 3 months – that is, back to the start date of your current policy period.

### You change your policy

You may want to make certain changes to your policy. This may include adding options to increase your cover, increasing your basic excess so you pay a lower premium or replacing your vehicle with a new one. An additional premium may apply to the change. You are required to pay the additional premium at the time the changes are made. If we make the change before you pay any additional premium, then you must pay the additional premium by the date we tell you it is due or we may remove the change from your policy. If we cannot remove the change and maintain cover, we may cancel your policy. If we agree to make the change, we will:

- issue you with a current Certificate of Insurance
- refund any amount we owe you.
---
You change your contact details If you change your contact details – for example, your mailing or email address – then you must tell us as soon as you reasonably can. If you don’t, then we will consider that you received your policy documents (that we sent to your old address) even though you didn’t. Other information you need to know We will continue to send your policy documents to your nominated mailing or email address until you tell us to update your contact details.

You want to cancel your policy You may decide to cancel your policy because you sell your vehicle or you no longer want your policy. If you tell us to cancel your policy and you: • paid an annual premium, we will refund your unused premium after we deduct: If you sell or give away your vehicle and replace it with another vehicle, then we may cover the replacement vehicle under ‘Temporary cover’ • pay your premium by monthly instalments, we will deduct: - any unpaid monthly instalments that are due, and - a cancellation fee of $30 (plus GST and any other government charges that apply) You authorize us to deduct the above amounts by direct debit from the account or credit card you previously nominated for monthly installment deductions.

## Changes we can make
