## Our agreement with you

Your insurance contract

When you buy the type of motor insurance cover you need, we enter into a contract with you which is called the policy and is made up of:

- your policy schedule;
- this Product Disclosure Statement (PDS),
- any applicable Supplementary PDS (SPDS); and
- any other document we tell you forms part of the policy at or prior to the commencement of the policy or when required or permitted by law, which may vary or modify the above documents.

This document (together with any amendments, updates or endorsements that we give you in writing which may vary it when required or permitted by law) will also apply for any offer of renewal we make, unless we tell you otherwise or issue you with a new and updated PDS.

If there is more than one insured on the policy, then anything that any of the insureds says, does or omits to advise to us of applies to and affects the rights of all of the insureds.

If you require further information about this product, please contact your appointed Insurance Broker.

## Your waiting period for cyclone, flood and bush fires

To manage the risk of people taking out motor insurance on their uninsured vehicles when events such as cyclones, floods or bush fires are predicted, we do not provide cover (where the type of cover you have provides it) for any loss of or damage to your vehicle caused by these events during the first 72 hours after the policy is first taken out by you (it does not apply to renewals). However, you will be covered from the time you take out the policy for covered loss of or damage to your vehicle not caused by these events.

This waiting period does not apply when:

- a new comprehensive policy is taken as a replacement of an existing comprehensive policy with no break in cover; or
- the vehicle you are insuring was purchased at the time the policy commences.
---
## Your policy schedule

Your policy schedule shows the type of cover you have and any optional covers you have added under the policy. It also shows the period that the policy covers you for called the period of insurance.

## Receiving your policy documents

You may choose to receive your policy documents:

- electronically (by email); or
- in hard copy (by post).

In the event that you choose to receive your documents electronically, we will send them to the email address that you provide us, not your mailing address. Any documents sent by email will be considered to have been received by you 24 hours from the time we sent them to your email address.

If you do not tell us to send your documents to you electronically, then we will send them to you by post to the mailing address that you have provided us.

It is your responsibility to make sure that both the email and mailing address you have provided us are up to date. This means you need to let us know if you change your email or mailing address as soon as reasonably possible (refer to “Changes to your policy”).

## Your responsibilities

It is up to you to choose the cover you need. Because we and our representatives do not advise you on whether the policy is specifically appropriate for your objectives, financial situation or needs, you should carefully read this document before deciding.

When entering into the policy or on renewal, variation, extension, or reinstatement (as applicable) you must meet your Duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation obligations. See under the heading ‘Your Duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation’.

You must during the term of the policy follow and meet all of the policy’s terms and conditions. In particular:

- take all reasonable care to prevent loss of (including theft) or damage to your vehicle. This includes but is not limited to:
---
keep your vehicle well maintained and in a roadworthy condition. This includes but is not limited to ensuring safety parts such as tyres, brakes and lights are in the condition necessary to allow the vehicle to be registered. We may reduce or refuse your claim to the extent that your vehicle’s maintenance or condition contributed to or caused the loss.

ensure that any information you give us as part of a claim document or statement to us is honest and complete

Not meeting your responsibilities If you do not meet your responsibilities then to the extent permitted by law we may do either or both of the following:

- reduce or refuse your claim to the extent we are prejudiced by your failure; and/or
- cancel your policy.

If fraud is involved we can treat your policy as if it never existed. The above rights are subject to any relevant law.

Special conditions We may impose special conditions on your policy that exclude, restrict or extend cover for a certain person or condition. An example of this would be when we may not cover certain drivers. These conditions will be listed on your policy schedule and you should read the policy schedule carefully.

The value we apply to your vehicle Depending on the type of insurance cover you choose, we may insure your vehicle for either an agreed value or for market value. The value that applies to your vehicle will be shown on your policy schedule.

Agreed value The agreed value is the specified amount we agree to insure your vehicle up to which is listed in the policy schedule. Typically, people seek to ensure that the amount takes into account:

- what it would cost to replace the vehicle. This can include:
- any modifications, options or accessories that have been made or added to the vehicle;
- GST;
- registration and any CTP insurance; and
- other on road costs such as stamp duty transfer, dealer warranty costs or transfer fees or dealer delivery.
---
## Market value

Market value is the cost to replace your vehicle with a vehicle of the same make, model, age and condition as your vehicle immediately prior to the loss or damage but excluding costs and charges for vehicle registration, CTP insurance, stamp duty transfer, dealer warranty costs or transfer fees or dealer delivery.

To determine the market value we look at things such as:

- local market prices;
- your vehicle’s condition; and
- any modifications, options or accessories that are attached to your vehicle and shown on the policy schedule.

## Your premium

In return for paying or agreeing to pay us your premium, we will provide the cover that you have chosen. Your premium will be based on our view of the likelihood of a claim being made on your policy during the term of the policy. When we work out the premium we look at a number of factors that have over time been shown to be a good determinate of the likelihood of a claim being made. Some of these factors include:

- the type of vehicle you have insured and where you keep it;
- the age of the insured and other people likely to drive the vehicle;
- the way you use your vehicle – for example, private, rideshare or business use;
- any discounts that may apply;
- any compulsory government charges such as Stamp Duty and GST;
- Fire or Emergency Services Levy, if they apply to the State or Territory where your vehicle is located;
- the excess you choose or that we apply based on our underwriting criteria.

Your premium for each period of insurance will be shown on your policy schedule.

We may deduct any outstanding premium amount or incorrectly refunded premium, from any claim payment.

Minimum premiums may apply. In some cases, discounts/entitlements may apply if you meet certain criteria we set. Any discounts/entitlements may be subject to rounding and only apply to the extent any minimum premium is not reached. If you are eligible for more than one, we also apply each of them in a predetermined order to the premium (excluding taxes and government charges) as reduced by any prior applied discounts/entitlements.

Any discounts/entitlements will be applied to the base premium calculated prior to any taxes being added.
---
Paying your premium
You must pay your premium on time. You can pay your premium:
• as a lump sum annually; or
• in instalments by direct debit from a bank account or credit card you nominate.
Your policy schedule shows the amount you need to pay and the due date for your annual premium or instalments.

What happens if you don’t pay your premium on time
You need to pay your annual premium or instalments by the due date. If you do not pay your premium by the due date, your policy may be cancelled and you may not be able to make a claim.
An instalment will be considered unpaid by us if it cannot be deducted from your nominated account or credit card. We understand that things can go wrong, so on the next payment date we’ll attempt to deduct the overdue amount along with the regular monthly payment. However if the next attempt to deduct the outstanding amount fails, we will unfortunately have to cancel the Policy. We will send you a notice advising you of cancellation, and cancellation will be effective 14 days from the date of this notice.

Twenty one day cooling off period
You can ask us to cancel your policy within 21 days from:
• the date we issued you a new policy; and
• the start date of a policy that you have renewed,
and in either of these situations, provided you have not made, or an event has not occurred that could give rise to, a claim on your policy, we will refund any premium you have paid.
We may deduct from your refund amount any government taxes or duties we cannot recover.
In addition to your cooling off period, you can cancel the policy at any time by calling us.
Refer to the “Cancellation rights under your policy” section for further details.

Renewing your policy
You will receive a renewal notice at least 14 days prior to the expiry date of the period of insurance advising whether we will offer renewal or not.
If we offer renewal, the renewal notice will set out the renewal terms, including the new premium, sums insureds and excess(es).
You should check the amount of your sum insured to see if your level of insurance cover is still appropriate for you prior to the policy being renewed.
---
In some cases, if you pay your premium by instalment an automatic renewal process may apply. We will tell you when you first take out the policy and at renewal if this automatic renewal process applies to you. Where this process applies, it means that if you are happy with the proposed renewal terms, and you don’t have to notify us of any matter required in the renewal notice, you won’t need to contact us. If we don’t hear from you by the expiry date we will automatically renew the policy on the terms proposed.

You can opt-out of the automatic renewal process at any time by contacting your appointed Insurance Broker. Contact details are provided on the back cover of this PDS. Where you have provided us with a nominated account/credit card we will also deduct the instalments for the new policy, unless you tell us not to.

If you don’t want to take up the renewal offer or need to vary it or the information listed, contact your broker before the renewal.

Each renewal is a separate policy, not an extension of the prior policy and the cooling off period applies on each renewal.

If you renew the policy you need to be aware that the premium we charge you is likely to change, even if there has been no change in the circumstances which were applicable to the policy when you first took it out or subsequently renewed it. This is because other factors may affect the premium, including:

- the cost of claims we have paid and that we expect to pay in the future;
- new data we have collected on the various factors we use to determine your premium;
- our expenses of doing business; and
- any other commercial considerations.

When calculating the premium that we charge you on renewal we also consider what your premium was previously, and we may limit movements up or down.

Assigning your rights

You are not allowed to assign any benefits, rights or, obligations under your policy unless you have our written permission to do so. We will not unreasonably withhold our permission.
---
Appointing a representative
You need to tell us if you want to have someone represent or support you then we will
recognise this and allow for it in all reasonable ways. This also applies if you want someone
to manage your policy or claim on your behalf.

Governing law
Your policy is governed by the law of the Australian State or Territory where your vehicle
is kept.

Your Duty to take reasonable care not to make
a misrepresentation
You must take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation to us. This responsibility
applies until we issue you with a policy for the first time or agree to renew, extend, vary/
change, or reinstate your policy.
You must answer our questions honestly, accurately and to the best of your knowledge. A
misrepresentation includes a statement that is false, partially false, or which does not fairly
reflect the truth. It is not misrepresentation if you do not answer a question or if your answer
is obviously incomplete or irrelevant to the question asked.
The responsibility to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation applies to
everyone who will be insured under the policy. If you are answering questions on behalf of
anyone, we will treat your answers or representations as theirs.
Whether or not you have taken reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation is to be
determined having regard to all relevant circumstances, including the type of insurance,
who it is intended to be sold to, whether you are represented by a broker, your particular
characteristics and circumstances we are aware of.
If you do not meet the above Duty, we may reject or not fully pay your claim and/or cancel
your policy. If the misrepresentation was deliberate or reckless, this is an act of fraud, and
we may treat your policy as if it never existed.
If our information or questions are unclear, you can contact us via the details on the back
cover or visit www.einsure.com.au/misrepresentation
---
Your No Claim Bonus (NCB) or Rating level

A no claims bonus (NCB) or rating level is only applicable when you take out Comprehensive insurance.

A no claims bonus or a rating level mean the same thing.

Your no claims bonus or rating level rewards you for not having made claims. With this feature, each additional consecutive year that you and the covered drivers on your policy have not had a claim helps keep your premium lower (up to a maximum NCB discount amount).

When you first take out each policy, we calculate the NCB or rating level based on:

- the NCB or rating level you held with your previous insurer; or

where you currently do not hold a NCB:

- the claims history of you and any other listed drivers; and
- the number of years you and any other listed drivers have been driving for, however if you or any other listed drivers have had more than one claim in the past 3 years your NCB will be 0%.

Your NCB discount may vary depending on which State or Territory your vehicle is kept in. Your policy schedule will show what NCB (if any) has been applied to your policy.

Each year at renewal the NCB for the policy is recalculated. After each subsequent claim free period of insurance, the NCB discount applied to your renewal premium will be increased by one discount level (i.e. 10%) until the maximum available NCB discount is reached. Your NCB or rating level may be reduced at renewal if a claim is made as outlined below.

Premiums are calculated prior to any no claim bonus discount being applied, see the “your premium” section for further information. A no claims bonus discount only applies to your base premium (excluding any policy options, government taxes, charges or levies that may apply).

The premium for a policy may increase as a result of a claim or due to other factors we determine in setting our premiums, regardless of whether the no claim bonus discount amount is altered.

What happens to my NCB or rating level at renewal if I make a claim?

In the event that you make a claim:

- that is an at-fault claim; or
- that is a not at-fault claim where:
---
where we are unable to recoup the expenses we incurred in providing cover for any accidental loss or damage to your vehicle or in covering any of your legal liability costs after a claimable event, your NCB or rating level will be reduced by 1 rating level (i.e. 10%) for each claim you make in any one period of insurance, except as provided in the “Claims that will not impact you no claim bonus or rating level at renewal” section below at renewal.

What happens to my NCB or rating level at renewal if I have Protected NCB and make a claim?

Your NCB or rating level will not be reduced at renewal where you have the optional Protected NCB benefit for the first claim you make in any one period of insurance:

- that is an at-fault claim; or
- that is a not at-fault claim where:
- you are unable to provide us with the responsible party’s name, address and vehicle registration number or any other information that would reasonably allow us to identify the person so that we can exercise our rights of recovery; or
- it is made due to any storm, naturally occurring event or a collision with an animal; or
- where we are unable to recoup the expenses we incurred in providing cover for any accidental loss or damage to your vehicle or in covering any of your legal liability costs after a claimable event.

However, your NCB or rating level will be reduced by a rating level (i.e. 10%), for each additional claim you make in any one period of insurance, except as provided in the “Claims that will not impact your no claim bonus or rating level at renewal” section below.

Claims that will not impact your no claim bonus or rating level at renewal

Your no claim bonus or rating level will not be impacted at renewal when:

- the driver of your vehicle at the time of the accident did not contribute to the cause of the accident, that is the claim is a recoverable one. Recoverable is a word with a special meaning in this document. This meaning is outlined in the section “Definitions”;
- your vehicle was damaged while parked, and you supply us with the name, address and licence number of the responsible party, or the registration number(s) of the other vehicle(s) involved in the accident or any other information that would reasonably allow us to identify the person so that we can exercise our rights of recovery;
- the amount we have paid out to cover your loss is recoverable; or
- your claim relates to the cost of repairing or replacing the windscreen or window glass of your vehicle if it is accidentally broken or damaged.
---
## Comprehensive insurance

Comprehensive insurance is the top level of Motor Insurance cover we provide. In order to be sure that you are covered under this policy you should always contact us for approval before you incur expenses you wish to claim. If you do not, we will pay for expenses incurred up to the amount we would have authorised had you sought approval from us first.

### Accidental loss of or damage to your vehicle

We will cover you for accidental loss of (including theft) or any other type of accidental damage that happens to your vehicle during the period of insurance, subject to the other terms of this section and the policy (including those relating to the limits and excess).

Where new for old replacement of a new vehicle after a total loss does not apply, at our option (acting reasonably) we will:

- repair your vehicle; or
- pay you the reasonable cost of repairing your vehicle; or
- pay you the market value of your vehicle when the policy schedule shows that your vehicle is insured for market value; or
- pay you the agreed value of your vehicle when the policy schedule shows that your vehicle is insured for an agreed value.

Further, we will adjust your claims payment in accordance with the GST provision shown under “GST Notice”.

### New for old replacement of a new vehicle after a total loss

We will replace your vehicle with a new vehicle of the same make, model, engine size, features and paint type including any modifications, options and accessories, so long as it is available in Australia, provided:

- your vehicle is a total loss;
- you purchased it new (or as a demonstrator model) from the manufacturer or their dealer;
- where your vehicle is financed, your financier has given us written consent; and
- your vehicle is less than three years old from when it was first registered at the time it is declared a total loss.

If the payment of an excess is applicable it is payable to us upfront before we replace your vehicle. If we replace your vehicle, the policy will continue to cover your new replacement vehicle until the end of the period of insurance. We will not require you to pay an additional premium for this cover.

If a new replacement vehicle is not available, we will pay you either the market value or agreed value of your vehicle, whichever is shown as applicable in the policy schedule.
---
Temporary cover on replacement vehicle
If you sell or give away your vehicle and replace it with another one, we will provide
temporary cover for the replacement vehicle only from the time you sold or gave the vehicle
away and acquired the replacement vehicle, whichever is the later, on the terms set out in
your policy, except that we will only insure the replacement vehicle for the market value.
Cover on the replaced vehicle ceases from the time you sold or gave the vehicle away.
You must advise us of the replacement vehicle as soon as practical after you sold or gave
away the existing vehicle and acquired the replacement vehicle.
When we receive this information, we may:
•      propose changes to the terms and conditions of your policy;
•      propose to charge you additional premium;
•      cancel your policy if you have replaced your vehicle and we can’t reach an agreement
with you on altered terms and conditions or premium; or we are no longer prepared to
insure you because there has been a material change to the risk; or
•      decide not to offer to renew your policy.
If you do not provide the information as soon as reasonably practical we may be entitled
to reduce, or refuse to pay a claim under the policy to the extent we are prejudiced by the
delay or failure to provide this information.
Other benefits we will pay
Unless we have stated differently under one of the other benefits listed below, the benefit
will only apply where we have accepted your claim for accidental loss of or accidental
damage to your vehicle (called a covered accident) under the policy and any payment we
may make under this section will be paid in addition to any amount payable for the loss of
or damage to your vehicle.
Removal of basic excess for a windscreen claim
If the windscreen, sunroof or window glass in your vehicle is accidentally broken or
damaged, we will not apply an excess to your claim.
This applies:
•      to one claim for a windscreen, sunroof or window glass replacement plus two
windscreen, sunroof or window glass repairs in any period of insurance; and
•      if the broken windscreen, sunroof or window glass is the only damage to your vehicle.
Your no claim bonus entitlement will not be impacted if your claim is only for the cost of
repairing or replacing the windscreen, sunroof or window glass in your vehicle and it is
accidentally broken or damaged.
---
Child seats or baby capsules

Following a covered accident, we will replace any child seat or baby capsule in your vehicle. The maximum we will pay in respect of any one incident is $650 per seat.

Emergency repairs

We will reimburse you for the cost of emergency repairs which may be necessary to enable you to drive your vehicle home after a covered accident. The maximum we will pay in respect of any one incident is $500.

Emergency accommodation and travelling expenses

We will pay for any reasonable additional travel or accommodation expenses incurred by you as a result of a covered accident, provided that at the time of the covered accident your vehicle was more than 100 kilometres from the address where it is normally parked at night. We will not pay accommodation expenses if you had intended to pay for overnight accommodation in any event. Travelling expenses extend to include the cost of collecting your vehicle following repairs.

Making a claim

Assisting us with your claim

You must assist us with your claim. This means give us all the information and assistance with your claim which we may reasonably require. If you do not we may not pay your claim (in whole or in part) or provide cover to the extent we are prejudiced by that failure. If we have the right to recover any amount payable under the policy from any other person, you must take reasonable steps to co-operate with us in any action we may take.

When you are at fault

You are at fault if you:

- are responsible for the accident; or
- contributed to the cause of an accident.

What we pay for

If we agree to settle your claim, we will (acting reasonably):

- decide whether to repair your vehicle, pay the reasonable cost of repairing your vehicle or pay the agreed or the market value or maximum sum insured (as applicable);
- pay any other benefits that apply;
- pay for any optional covers you have chosen and paid for; and
- deduct any amounts that apply to the policy such as excess or unpaid premium.

The most we will pay

This will depend on what level of insurance cover you have chosen:

- if you have Comprehensive insurance we will pay either the agreed or market value (as applicable);
- if you have Third Party Fire & Theft insurance the most we will pay is the vehicle’s market value up to $5,000;
- if you have chosen either Third Party Property Damage or Third Party Fire & Theft insurance and claim under the uninsured motorist’s extension, then the most we will pay is $5,000,

and any other amounts that may be payable under any additional or optional benefits that apply to your cover.
---
How we will settle your claim

We may choose to settle your claim in any of these ways (acting reasonably).

Repair your vehicle

We can arrange for one of our selected repairers to repair your vehicle or you can arrange for your own repairer. To see what happens when a decision is being made on a repairer see the section “Choosing a repairer”.

Pay you the reasonable cost of repairing your vehicle

Rather than repair your vehicle we can choose (acting reasonably) to pay you the reasonable cost of repairing it. If we choose this approach we will determine the reasonable cost by examining a number of factors. This may include the quote from your nominated repairer and other repairers as well as reports from our trained assessors.

We may choose (acting reasonably) the approach of paying you the reasonable cost of repairing your vehicle where we are not satisfied with the repairer you choose.

Pay your claim as a total loss

We may pay out your claim as a total loss when we consider your vehicle to be a total loss or we choose to do so. If we pay out your claim as a total loss, your policy comes to an end and there is no refund of premium to you for any unexpired period of the policy unless we replace your vehicle under the “New for old replacement of a new vehicle after a total loss” benefit.

For Comprehensive insurance we pay the market or agreed value (as applicable) less:

- the excess; and
- any unpaid premium.

We will keep the vehicle. At our discretion (and if safe to do so), you may reclaim the vehicle if you agree to pay the salvage price.

For Third Party Fire and Theft insurance if the market value is less than $5,000 we will pay you the market value less:

- the excess; and
- any unpaid premium.

You would then keep the vehicle.

For Third Party Fire and Theft insurance if the market value is over $5,000 we will pay you the market value less any salvage value, up to a maximum amount of $5,000 less:

- the excess; and
- any unpaid premium

You would then keep the vehicle.
---
If we have paid a claim following theft and the vehicle is then recovered after we have paid the claim, the recovered vehicle will become our property. At our discretion (and if safe to do so) you may reclaim the recovered vehicle if you agree to pay the salvage price.

For Third Party Fire and Theft insurance and Third Party Property Damage insurance, if we settle your claim under the “Uninsured motorist extension” we will pay you the market value up to $5,000 less:

- our estimated salvage value; and
- any unpaid premium.

You would then keep the vehicle.

Paying for other benefits

If we agree to pay you other benefits under the policy, we will pay the reasonable cost. We will repair, replace or pay the relevant loss or damage (as applicable) up to the maximum amount that applies under the benefit.

What happens to your property

Recovered vehicles

If we settle your claim under Comprehensive insurance and it is a total loss and the vehicle is later recovered we will usually keep the recovered vehicle. At our discretion (and if safe to do so), you may reclaim the recovered vehicle if you agree to pay the salvage price.

Damaged property

If we settle the claim for a damaged item then it becomes our property. At our discretion (and if safe to do so), you may reclaim the recovered vehicle if you agree to pay the salvage price.

Credit provider’s rights

You must tell us if you have used the vehicle as security for a loan. This may also apply if you have a lease or hire purchase agreement on your vehicle.

When you do this we note the credit provider on your policy schedule.

When there is a credit provider noted:

- we treat the vehicle as being under a finance arrangement;
- we treat any statement, act, or omission or claim by you as a statement, act or omission by the credit provider; and
- we may recover any payment either in your name or the credit provider’s name.
---
Payments to the credit provider

If we pay your claim as a total loss settlement on your vehicle that is under a finance arrangement, we first pay the credit provider the lower of these amounts after deducting any excess and deductions that apply:

- the agreed value or market value;
- the cost of repairing your vehicle; and
- the balance owing to the credit provider under the finance arrangement.

If the credit provider is entitled to the salvage of the vehicle, we will deduct the estimated salvage value of the vehicle from any amount we pay them.

However, we will only pay the credit provider if they:

- are noted on your policy schedule; and
- give us any help we reasonably ask for.

If we make a payment to a credit provider, then that payment discharges our obligation to you under your policy for the amount paid.

If we decide to settle your claim as a total loss, before we settle your claim:

- we will check the Personal Property Securities Register to confirm whether any money is owing on your vehicle; and
- you must settle any finance arrangement over your vehicle and remove it from that register or agree for us to pay (and provide all information we reasonably require to pay) the settlement amount (up to the outstanding balance on the finance arrangement) directly to the credit provider.

GST Notice

The policy has a GST provision in relation to premium and our payment to you for claims. It may have an impact on how you determine the amount of insurance you need. Please read it carefully. Seek professional advice if you have any queries about GST and your insurance.

Sums insured

All monetary limits in the policy may be adjusted for GST in some circumstances (see below).

Claim settlements – where we agree to pay

When we calculate the amount we will pay you, we will have regard to the items below:

Acquisition of goods, services or repairs

Where you are liable to pay an amount for GST in respect of an acquisition relevant to your claim (such as services to repair a damaged item insured under the policy) we will pay for the GST amount. We will pay the GST amount in addition to the sum insured/limit of indemnity or other limits shown in the policy or in this schedule (unless we state GST is included in Sum Insured or Limit of Indemnity).
---
If your sum insured/limit of liability is not sufficient to cover your loss, we will only pay the GST amount that relates to our settlement of your claim. We will reduce the GST amount we pay for by the amount of any input tax credits to which you are or would be entitled.

Payment as compensation

Where we make a payment under the policy as compensation instead of payment for a relevant acquisition, we will reduce the amount of the payment by the amount of any input tax credit that you would have been entitled to had the payment been applied to a relevant acquisition.

Disclosure – Input tax credit entitlement

If you register, or are registered, for GST you are required to tell us your entitlement to an input tax credit on your premium. If you fail to disclose or understate your entitlement, you may be liable for GST on a claim we may pay. The policy does not cover you for this GST liability, or for any fine, penalty or charge for which you may be liable.

Recovery against another party

We have the right to recover from any person, in your name, the amount of any claim paid under the policy and we have full discretion in the conduct, settlement or defence of any claim in your name. We will act reasonably having regard to your interests, and will keep you informed if you ask us to. If we recover more than the amount we have paid to you or on your behalf, we will pay you the balance.

The amount of any excess you have paid will only be refunded when your claim is recoverable.

Repairing your vehicle

If we choose the option of repairing your vehicle, we will decide (acting reasonably) the best way of repairing any damage that exists.

In order to be sure that you are covered under this policy you should always contact us for approval before you start any repairs on your vehicle, unless you have Comprehensive insurance and they are emergency repairs as detailed under the “Emergency repairs” benefit. If you do not, we will pay for expenses incurred up to the amount we would have authorised had you sought approval from us first.

Choosing a repairer

Allianz can assist you in selecting a suitable repairer to repair the damage to your vehicle. You also have the right to choose your own repairer. In both instances we will work closely with the repairer to strive to achieve the best repair outcome for you however we may require a second quotation from a repairer chosen by us. We will then choose (subject to any relevant policy limits and acting reasonably) to:

- authorise the repairs at your repairer of choice;
- pay you the reasonable cost of repairing your vehicle;
---
move your vehicle to a repairer we both agree will repair your vehicle. In the instance that we both agree to move your vehicle we will provide you with a rental car for up to three days in addition to any other benefit provided under your policy. The maximum we will pay for the rental car is $100 per day.

Authorising repairs

Where you have Comprehensive insurance you may only authorise emergency repairs as detailed under the “Emergency repairs” benefit. You should not authorise further repairs to your vehicle without our prior consent.

Before we make a decision regarding your claim and repairs to your vehicle, we may need to inspect your vehicle. A motor vehicle assessor will be appointed by us. We or our assessor will make the necessary arrangements with you.

Where diagnosis (such as the stripping of engine) is required to determine if there has been damage covered by the policy, if you or we incur costs for such diagnosis and reassembly and the claim is subsequently accepted as valid by us, we will bear these costs subject to the applicable sum insured/limits of liability.

Parts used to repair your vehicle

If we are unable to repair the part, we use new, recycled or reconditioned parts that meet the requirements of Australian Design Rules (ADR). If such parts are not available or appropriate, parts from alternative distribution channels may be used.

We will not pay any amount greater than the maker’s last list price in Australia (together with a reasonable charge for fitting) for the supply of any spare part, extra or accessory.

In the event that any spare part, extra or accessory cannot be obtained within a reasonable time, we may choose to pay you the value of the spare part, extra or accessory (together with a reasonable charge for fitting) rather than supply the spare part, extra or accessory.

Guarantee on repairs

We guarantee materials and workmanship on repairs we authorise for as long as you own or lease your vehicle. This guarantee is not transferable.

Unrepaired damage

If your vehicle had any unrepaired damage before an incident, then you may need to contribute to the repair costs.

You need to do this when the damage caused by the incident results in us having to repair more areas of your vehicle than were affected by the unrepaired damage. Before we ask you to contribute we will explain why, tell you how much it will be and how to pay it prior to the authorisation of any repairs.

Undamaged areas

We will not repair undamaged areas of your vehicle that have not been affected by damage caused by the incident to ensure a uniform appearance. However, when we repair your vehicle, we will make best efforts to use the nearest available equivalent to the original materials or item.
---
## Our Excesses

There are different types of excesses which may apply to you or the driver of your vehicle at the time of the claim. The excess types are shown on the policy schedule under the heading “Excess applicable to claims”.

You may have to pay more than one excess.

### Basic Excess

The basic excess is the amount you must pay as a contribution to each claim. The amount of the basic excess will be shown on the policy schedule, next to the heading “Basic excess”.

If we settle your claim by cash settlement we will deduct the excess from the amount we pay you. In other circumstances, you may need to pay the excess as a contribution to the repair or replacement.

The basic excess is comprised of the “Minimum basic excess”, the “Voluntary excess” and any “Imposed excess”.

- Minimum basic excess: The Minimum basic excess that is due under the policy for each claim. The amount of the minimum basic excess will be shown on the policy schedule.
- Voluntary excess: Choosing a Voluntary excess allows you to reduce your premium by selecting a higher Basic excess. It applies in addition to the Minimum basic excess. The Voluntary excess you choose will be shown on the policy schedule.
- Imposed excess: An Imposed excess may be applied to a policy due to risk based underwriting criteria. It applies in addition to the Minimum basic excess. Any Imposed excess amount will be shown on the policy schedule.

### Age Excess

If you make a claim for an accident that occurred when your vehicle was being driven by a driver under the age of 25, you must pay the Age excess shown in the policy schedule in addition to the Basic excess.

### Undeclared Young Driver Excess

If you make a claim for an accident when your vehicle was being driven by a driver under the age of 25, who was not listed in your policy schedule, the Undeclared young driver excess shown on the policy schedule must be paid in addition to the Basic excess and Age excess.
---
Inexperienced driver excess

You will need to pay the Inexperienced driver excess shown on the policy schedule in addition to the Basic excess payable if you make a claim for an accident when your vehicle was being driven by a driver over the age of 25 who had not held their current Australian or overseas driver’s licence for more than two consecutive years.

Theft excess

Applicable only where specified on the policy schedule.

If you make a claim for loss or damage caused by or arising from theft or attempted theft of your vehicle, you will need to pay the Theft excess shown in your policy schedule in addition to all other applicable excesses shown in your policy schedule.

Driver excess

Applicable only where specified on the policy schedule.

The Driver excess will be applied if you make a claim for an incident which occurred whilst the vehicle is being driven by the person listed on the policy schedule. This Driver excess is in addition to all other excesses applicable to your policy.

Unnamed driver excess

When the policy schedule shows that the “Named driver option” applies, we will apply an Unnamed driver excess (as shown in the policy schedule) if you make a claim for an incident that occurred when your vehicle was being driven by any driver that is not listed in the policy schedule as a named driver.

This Unnamed driver excess of $2,500, if payable, replaces all other excesses applicable to your policy.
---
When you do not have to pay an excess
You will not have to pay any excess if:
• the claim relates to damage, that was the fault of a person other than the driver of your car, at the time of the incident; and
• you can provide us with the name and contact details of the other person or any other information that would reasonably allow us to identify the person so that we can exercise our rights of recovery; and
• the claimable loss is recoverable by us.
You will not have to pay any Age excess (Under 25 Driver), Unnamed driver excess or Driver excess if you are claiming for any of the following:
• windscreen or window glass damage only;
• theft;
• hail, storm, cyclone, bush fire or flood damage;

• damage to your vehicle while parked.
You will not have to pay any Age excess (Under 25 Driver), Undeclared young driver excess, Inexperienced driver excess or Unnamed driver excess if the driver:
• stole or was illegally using your vehicle;
• had been paid by you to repair, service or test your vehicle;
• was an attendant at a car park; or
• was a learner driver accompanied by the holder of a full unrestricted Australian drivers licence.
Other deductions
If we finalise your claim as a total loss we deduct the following amounts before we pay out your claim:
• any unpaid premiums or instalment payments that cover the rest of your period of insurance for the policy; and
• salvage value, if applicable. Normally we will keep the vehicle in the event of a total loss but if we agree to let you keep the wreck then we will deduct its estimated salvage value.

If this insurance has been issued through an insurance intermediary If your policy has been issued through our agent, or a broker who is acting under a binder arrangement with us, then they are acting as our agent and not as your agent. If your policy has been issued by a broker, other than a broker acting under a binder arrangement with us, then the broker is acting as your agent. Where the policy has been arranged through an intermediary a commission is payable by us to them for arranging the insurance. You can ask them or us for more information.

Financial Claims Scheme In the unlikely event Allianz Australia Insurance Limited were to become insolvent and could not meet its obligations under the policy, a person entitled to claim may be entitled to payment under the Financial Claims Scheme. Access to the Scheme is subject to eligibility criteria. More information can be obtained from http://www.fcs.gov.au.

Other documents may form part of the PDS and the policy, for example schedules, Supplementary PDSs and/or endorsements.
